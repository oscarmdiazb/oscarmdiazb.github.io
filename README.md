**Welcome to my website!** 

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Paris School of Economics, primarily interested in the economics of human capital formation in developing countries. 
I strive for a better understanding of the determinants and dynamics of learning poverty and inequality; how individuals and societies accumulate knowledge and know-how; and whether we need a revindication of luck and not merit as the main driver of what we can become and do.
